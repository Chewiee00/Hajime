## Title
HAJIME: A Mobile-based QR-code Attendance Management System and Elo-based Rating System  Application for Judo Clubs or Teams
## Abstract 
In the context of sports training, specifically in Judo,
one major challenge faced by the team is to put attendances in
every session, and as well as manage them. Another challenge
is lack of integration of within-team competitions along with

QR codes for attendance system and utilizing the Elo rating
system for rating the members of the team/club. Concretely, a
dedicated mobile application tailored to the unique needs of judo
teams or clubs. This application possesses features that not only
streamline attendance management but also facilitate within-
team tournaments seamlessly integrated with the Elo rating
system.
